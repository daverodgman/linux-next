Qualcomm SMD-RPM interconnect driver binding
------------------------------------------------
The RPM (Resource Power Manager) is a dedicated hardware engine
for managing the shared SoC resources in order to keep the lowest
power profile. It communicates with other hardware subsystems via
the shared memory driver (SMD) back-end and accepts requests for
various resources.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,interconnect-smd-rpm"

Example:
	smd {
		compatible = "qcom,smd";

		rpm {
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 168 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
			qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 0>;
			qcom,smd-edge = <15>;

			rpm_requests {
				compatible = "qcom,rpm-msm8916";
				qcom,smd-channels = "rpm_requests";

				interconnect-smd-rpm {
					compatible = "qcom,interconnect-smd-rpm";
				};

			};
		};
	};
